# MEAN-FIELD LIMITS FOR LARGE-SCALE RANDOM-ACCESS NETWORKS

The code in this repository support the results in the paper "Mean-Field Limits for Large-Scale Random-Access Networks".

Features currently availables:

- Simulate CSMA network -> Stochastic model denoted X^{(N)}(t)

- Solve differential equation (3.1) limit of X^{(N)}(t) as N goes to infinity
